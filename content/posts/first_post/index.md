I finally got around to writing a static page website using zola. I can now save snippets of insight on here to refer back later or
just have tips and tricks that will be of help to other people. Right now I'm learning the rust ðŸ¦€ programming language and working 
on my arch install and arch config scripts.

Things to update in the site:
- detect preferred theme from browser.
- dark theme doesn't invert pictures (when theme="dark" when webpage loaded)

Some of the things I plan to do over summer: 
- start a hobby youtube channel.
- learn emacs or vim.
- optimize my workflow.
- learn to write pdfs using LaTeX.
- increase typing speed.
- potentially add a comments section to posts.
