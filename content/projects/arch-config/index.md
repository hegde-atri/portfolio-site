# [My dotfiles script](https://github.com/hegde-atri/.dotfiles)

After starting make multiple configs for multiple use cases, computers/VM's
I've decided to make myself a script that allows me to switch between my configs,
create a new config, or update a config all without the trouble of managing them manually.

After scripting my [arch-install](https://github.com/hegde-atri/arch-install) I've gotten a lot more
comfortable with bash scripting, although I wouldn't bet on the quality its written in, as there is no 
error checking or validation.
