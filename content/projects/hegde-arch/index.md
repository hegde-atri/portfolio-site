# hegde-arch [(Github)](https://github.com/hegde-atri/hegde-arch)

I have had enough hopping between different configs, colour-schemes, window managers and applications. Soon I will be starting university and will not have
enough time to do any of the things I used to do, and have time to experiment with different software. I think I have gotten pretty comfortable
using some of the software that I am using currently and therefore decided to start a repository for basically having everything I need.

The deadline I have set for this is December 2022. It will be aesthetically pleasing (highly subjective) and have all the features I need to make my life easier.
It will by no means be an iso. It will just a git repo that you can clone and use to install arch and my configs.

## Software
