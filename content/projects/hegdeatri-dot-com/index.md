# Personal website [(GitHub)](https://hegdeatri.com)

After a trying out a bunch different frameworks including - yew, blazor, angular and gatsby, I have decided 
to use zola for my website. Reasons being:
- Its very easy to update and add new stuff in markdown.
- Very fast.
- Can build upon an already existing theme, and its templates.

After reading through some excellent docs at [getzola.org](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/),
I chose my theme of choice which was [DeepThought](https://www.getzola.org/themes/deepthought/), and started hacking away at
the config.toml and make my own template for the [about page](https://hegdeatri.com/about).

I plan on making a video that will walk through setting up a small website on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHZwj1GpsDQ3B9S5VjeY36A) sometime in the future.
