# Warehouse Management 

This project is currently in the planning phase!

## Current problems + Analysis

There are no free warehouse management software that is tested for exploits, or can be written in unsafe code.
My goal for this project is to build a reliable application that can be used on a daily basis.


## Plan

My project will include two Stages, getting a desktop app working with a backend database, and then getting
a website working that can be used for customers

### Stage 1

Cross-platform desktop app that can be used by staff/internal use only.

### Stage 2

A website that can be used by customers to order your goods.

## Design

I am considering using either Avalonia UI or .NET MAUI frameworks as both provide me with a single codebase for all platforms (mobile + desktop + web).
Unfortunately .NET MAUI, the framework I wanted to use does not support Linux.

## Build

## Testing

## Maintainance

## Extra

If you want to use this software in a professional setting, and would like addition of specific
features/compatability (example: support for ARM devices with NFC login) get in contact with me through my email: [atri@hegdeatri.com](mailto:atri@hegdeatri.com).

Pricing for support coming soon.
